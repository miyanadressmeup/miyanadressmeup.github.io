<br>
<br>“Shredding” is the processing of dropping body fat to extremely low levels, usually within a time period of around 8-12 weeks. It’s a process that is often utilised by bodybuilders, but regular gym goers can go through ‘shredding’ phases in preparation for holidays or other big events. Shredding is both mentally and physically tough, and requires 100% commitment.
<br>
<br>Shredding is effectively all about becoming very lean; getting rid of those last really stubborn bits of fat we carry around our abdomen and hips. Women in particular may spend hours in the gym on the ellipticals without really changing their body shape, something that can be both frustrating and a complete waste of time.
<br>
<br>A female who is serious about getting shredded will be aiming to drop her body fat to around 10-13% of her total body percentage; it takes serious dedication and it will affect all areas of your life. Be prepared for your social life to take a massive hit; social drinks and indulgent dinners are generally ruled out because of serious calorie control, and training has to be prioritised over play time.

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">Why you would want to do it?&nbsp;</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Mainly people want to “shred” to look good! It’s a huge confidence booster.
<br>Getting “shredded” isn’t about starving yourself however, it’s about eating the right amount of the right foods, whilst working hard to maintain a healthy body and increasing your own mindset. Excess fat comes with a whole host of problems, diabetes, heart disease and poor confidence to name a few. Working out correctly and eating well promotes mental wellbeing, decreases body fat, improves posture, increases bone density and strength; the benefits are endless.
<br>Shredding allows you to take control of your body and to start putting thought into what you’re actually consuming on a daily basis, as well as developing awareness of your own appetite.
<br>
<br>For the regular gym goer, shredding is a fab way to get a bit leaner before a holiday, or maybe a wedding, but some women may use shredding as preparation before a bodybuilding competition.<br><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>What are the best exercises for shredding?</strong>
<br>Exercises that focus on compound movements are key, as are the ones that recruit the largest amount of muscle fibres.
<br>
<br>Examples of these are:
<br>Squats
<br>    Deadlifts
<br>    Bench press
<br>    Pull ups
<br>    Dips
<br>    Lunges 
<br>These moves should be central to your programme, supported by supporting isolation movements. These supporting movements will be need to be tailored to your individual body needs and are dependent on what your weakest areas are.
<br>Follow with around 20 minutes of HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training), or incorporate 20 minutes of steady state exercise into your session.<br><br></p>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-title mbr-fonts-style align-center mb-4 display-2"><strong>This routine will implement a number of tried-and-true training principles:</strong></h3>
                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7"><div>
</div><div>&nbsp; The Rep Goal Method - For example, if the routine prescribes 3 sets with a rep goal of 25, then you should aim to perform 25 TOTAL reps across all 3 sets. When you perform more than or equal to 25 reps you increase the working weight for the subsequent workout.
</div><br><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Progressive Overload</strong><span style="font-size: 1.1rem;">- adding reps and weight to bar will force your body to preserve as much lean mass as possible.&nbsp;</span></div><div>
<strong>Rest-Pause Sets</strong><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"> - pick a rep goal, number of sets, short rest period (10-45 seconds) and a conservative weight with which you believe you can exceed the rep goal given the set and rep goal parameters. Adhere strictly to the short rest periods and increase the working weight for the next session when you exceed the rep goal.&nbsp;</span></div><div>
<strong>Drop Sets</strong><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"> - perform one set to technical failure, decrease the weight by a reasonable amount, and then perform another set to technical failure. The number of drops can range from as few as 2 to as many as 5. Track total reps and utilize the rep goal method to measure progress.</span></div><div>
<strong>AMRAP</strong><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"> - perform as many reps as you can with good form; if you feel as though you may fail on the next rep or be unable to complete it with good form, terminate the set.&nbsp;</span></div><div><strong>Finisher Circuit</strong><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"> - the last component of each weight training workout will have you perform a series of back-to-back bodyweight and dumbbell-based exercises without rest. After you complete one round of the circuit, rest, and repeat the prescribed number of times. You can perform this finisher circuit anywhere, anytime outside of your normal workout window if you are strapped for time - upon waking, during lunch, or before bed.&nbsp;</span></div><br><div><br></div><div><br></div></h4>
