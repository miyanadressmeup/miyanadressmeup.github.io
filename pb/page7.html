                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Are you someone who can never have enough lipsticks or someone who prefers to stick to your trusted nudes? Your Instagram feed must be flooded with new make-up products and launches every now and then, tempting you to buy something new every month. It's easy to want to get your hands on every new make-up product that you think will complement your skin. But it's difficult to know which one is right and which one is wrong for you. This brings us to talk about little tips that help you pick on the right kind of make-up so that you don't end up putting a hole in your pocket by investing in the wrong product.
<br>- Always look out for cruelty-free make-up products: It's recommended to search for hypoallergenic make-up products. Also, look out for products that are not tested on animals or products that are classics and won't be overnight fads.
<br>
<br>- Do your research: Don't pick products based on their prices. Not every high-end make-up product is meant for you. A lot of research should go into what product is built for your skin type and skin concerns. Don't buy products just because they look fancy or their packaging looks catchy to your eyes.
<br>- Do the prep work before using the product: Make-up is a combination of art, research and technology. Take each of these aspects into consideration before making any purchases. When it comes to make-up, the touch and the feel is everything. This is why you should try all products for a patch test before you actually start using them.
<br>
<br>- Red flags that you should keep an eye out for: When you shop in-store make-up products, you should test them for any kind of issues beforehand. Look out for these red flags before you invest a huge amount into buying that product:
<br>
<br>* Mascaras that are too flaky and dry.
<br>
<br>* Lip-glosses or lipsticks that bleed.
<br>
<br>* Eyeliners that are too creamy.
<br>
<br>* Foundations that are too thick.
<br>
<br>* Blushes that are too pigmented.
<br>
<br>* Eyeshadows that are too heavy on the skin.
<br>
<br>* Products that oxidize on the skin.</p>
