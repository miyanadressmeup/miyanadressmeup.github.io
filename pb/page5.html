                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>&nbsp;1. Drink lots of water.
<br></strong>
<br>When it’s cold outside we often forget to drink enough water throughout the day, but this is just when low humidity is most likely to strip our poor skin of its moisture. Remember to sip slowly through the day rather than gulp and to use a reusable bottle. Indulging in warming winter teas such as natural ginger and lemon is a wonderful way to keep hydrated in winter - you will feel healthy, hydrated and cozy at the same time. It’s a win-win situation!
<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>2. Choose a cleanser carefully.
<br></strong>
<br>Many high street cleansers actually contain harsh chemicals which can be damaging rather than nourishing. Ingredients such as alcohol and any added fragrances won’t do any favors for dry, cracked skin, as they strip away natural oils. Cream-based cleansers which helps to keep the moisture in, while still taking off the day’s dirt and make-up.
<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>3. Exfoliate for excellent skin.
<br></strong>
<br>It may be the last thing on your mind when you have dry, itchy skin, but there are benefits to exfoliating your skin during winter. Not only will it take off the dry, dead skin cells, but it also helps you regenerate new ones. Your skin will thank you for using natural, exfoliating scrubs like this yummy-smelling geranium and orange scrub, or even check out this list of five homemade recipes that are easy to make using just ingredients from your kitchen pantry!
<br><br><strong>4. Keep those showers short and sweet.
<br></strong>
<br>It’s tempting to reach for that dial and turn up the heat and have a long, hot shower or a bath when it’s cold outside. However, hot showers and long baths are a big no-no. Not only will excessively hot water dehydrate you, but it will also strip away those necessary oils from your body. If you come out of the shower and your skin is irritatingly red and itchy, it’s a sign that you’ve overdone it. All is not lost though. We’ve got you covered in the next step.
<br><br><strong>5. Use a natural moisturizer and apply immediately after washing.
<br></strong>
<br>Choose your facial moisturizer and body lotion carefully. We recommend oil based products rather than water based to keep important hydrating oils in your skin. Apply moisturizer or lotion immediately after washing to lock in as much moisture as possible, and don’t forget to include your hands and your feet, the most hardworking parts of your body! Our favorite for your body? This heavenly body butter is a blend of organic butters and oils, topped up with a therapeutic blend of aromatic essential oils. If you recently ran out of body lotion, look inside your pantry for a tub of coconut oil; beauty editors swear by this versatile pantry essential!
<br><br><strong>6. Protect from the elements.
<br></strong>
<br>Winter is undoubtedly harsher on your skin than summer. Out in the open, we may have the pocket essential lip balm to take care of dry, chapped lips, but we need more than that. The combination of low humidity plus those strong, blistering winds can lead to uncomfortably dry skin, so remember to wrap up. A scarf and gloves are essential to protect your hands and the delicate skin on your neck; we love these scarf and gloves by Ally Bee that are made out of super soft alpaca and sheeps wool for minimal irritation.
<br>
<br>On the topic of skin irritation, a lot of cold-weather clothing can be uncomfortable when worn in direct contact with your skin. We recommend using natural, breathable base layers, such as the ones offered by The White T-Shirt Company, to protect you from any rough or scratchy winter fabrics that are aggravating to your skin when&nbsp;</p>
