                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><br>Before you decide to buy piercings, you first need to get pierced. Most of you must be familiar with the term 'shooting' or 'piercing'. But for those of you who are not known, 'shooting' is only to be used for piercing the earlobe. Any other type of piercing should be done by hand. 'Shooting' piercing still happens, specifically for ear piercings, that is extremely risky as the cartilage might break and shatter on the force of impact. Broken and shattered cartilage can result in scar tissue and mutilated ears. These are the reasons that piercings should be performed with a needle. Pushing a pointed needle through the skin with controlled pressure will prevent scar tissue growth. The essential aspects of piercings are hygiene. Before you get it done with a needle make sure both the needle and secondary equipment are clean, as in bacteria-free(especially during the ongoing situation).&nbsp;</p>
