                                <p class="mbr-content-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"></p><p>15th December 2019<br><br><br><br>Fashion is expression, and your personal style dictates what you say about yourself.
<br>
<br>I have said this before, but the truth of this statement is undeniable. We might not admit it, but we make judgements and draw conclusions about a person based on how they dress, even if it’s subconsciously.
<br>Now this is not necessarily a bad thing. Because it also means that we can express ourselves and show our identities through our clothing. And the best way to project a consistent image of yourself is by finding and refining your personal style. This process starts with getting to know your fashion personality.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>What is a fashion personality?
<br>
<br>A fashion personality is the innately unique character within each one of us that is <strong>expressed through certain style choices</strong>. And just like everyone has a personality, everyone also has a fashion personality. Time to let it out!
<br>Ideally, your fashion personality will coincide with both your tastes and preferences and your <strong>lifestyle</strong>. But even if you have to stick to a certain dress code (for example, at work), you can still incorporate items that reflect your fashion personality into your outfits. Say you work in a corporate environment but you lean towards the expressive fashion personality. You could choose a more daring handbag, necklace, or other statement item to let your personality shine through without pushing boundaries.
<br>We all have those days where we see an item of clothing in a shop that just speaks to us even though it’s not something we would normally reach for – or maybe, we are attracted to it because we would not normally wear it. But beware of these items! Most likely, they will end up in the back of your wardrobe because they won’t go with anything else you own.
<br>If you often end up purchasing items that don’t go well with the rest of your wardrobe, it might be because you are<strong> confused about your fashion personality</strong>.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p>

<br>Benefits of knowing your fashion personality
<br>
<br>Being able to project a consistent image of your personality
<br>Feeling more comfortable in your clothing
<br>Less confusion when shopping for new items
<br>Being able to express yourself and your identity through your clothing
<br>
<br>The 4 main fashion personalities
<br>Just like everyone’s personality is unique, it may not be possible to confine your fashion personality exactly to one category. However, in general, we talk about 4 main fashion personalities and you will fall into one or the other. Within these there are many sub-categories and you might even find yourself mixing up different sub-types according to your own taste and preferences.
<br>But the main point is that you stick with one of the four main fashion personalities when you are out shopping for new items. This will help keep your look consistent.
<br>The classic fashion personality can be described in three words: timeless, elegant, and put together. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

                                <p class="mbr-content-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><br>1.CLASSIC
<br> 
<br>You prefer timeless clothing and accessories over trend items. Tradition is important to you and even a casual dress code is an opportunity to look smart.
<br>Women with a classic fashion personality prefer timeless fashion designs – tailored trousers; single-breasted, semi-fitted jackets; elegant pumps. Elegant but simple cuts, fine natural fabrics, and handbag designs that have stood the test of time speak to you. Your wardrobe most likely harbors a trench coat and a little black dress.
<br>A classic handbag collection will include designer items that never go out of style. And your jewellery will tend to contain sparkly items, pearls, and perhaps even diamonds.
<br>
<br>The classic color palette contains mostly neutrals – such as whites, beige, greys, browns, navy, and black.
<br>
<br> 2.RELAXED
<br> 
<br>Comfort is the number one priority for this fashion personality. This doesn’t mean they turn up looking like a slob. It just means that they would happily forgo those six-inch heels for more comfy, but equally chic sneakers.
<br>In general, though, your looks tend to be a lot more casual and easy-going. Simple lines and designs are your preferred choices over anything too detailed. Your wardrobe probably contains lots of jeans, t-shirts, and sweats in breathable fabrics – such as cotton jersey, and lightweight knits, but also denim.
<br>When it comes to handbags, you lay more importance on usefulness than looks. And a look into your jewellery collection will most likely reveal very basic and minimal items.
<br>The relaxed color palette contains lots of neutrals – such as white, greys, olive green, denim blue, and black.

<br>
<br>You prefer commanding, flamboyant, and exciting looks, and you don’t hold back in your clothing. Fashion is a way of expressing your dramatic personality. 
<br>Your way of dressing is innovative and individualistic and you aren’t overly influenced by current trends or traditional rules. You make your own fashion rules. 
<br>Unconventional cuts and styles, creative prints, and striking color combinations are your preferred choices. Your wardrobe is likely filled with different colors, textures, and prints. 
<br>Your handbags and accessories are anything but conventional, often in unusual shapes and clashing colors, and always statement-making. 
<br>The expressive color palette contains nothing but saturated, bold, stand-out colors from bright yellow over hot pink to dark blue. 
<br>
<br>
<br>4.FEMININE 
<br>
<br>You prefer a soft appearance, flowing silhouettes, and muted colors. Your clothing choices are pretty and you love small, feminine details – such as bows, ruffles, pleats, and lace. You love to enhance your natural beauty by incorporating feminine details and flattering fits. 
<br>Even your casual outfits come with decorative details and your wardrobe likely contains lots of floral prints, twirling skirts, silk blouses, and flowy dresses. 
<br>You choose handbags in cute designs and with small details. Your jewellery collection will include fine necklaces and perhaps antique items. 
<br>When it comes to shoes, short heels and ballet flats are among your staples. 
<br>The feminine color palette contains mostly muted colors – such as whites, beige, dusty pinks, blues and greens, and browns.&nbsp;<br></p>
